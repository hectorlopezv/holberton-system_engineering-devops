In the context of software development projects, a Postmortem analysis is the process of reviewing the history of the project to understand how each of the events contributed to the success or failure of the project.

In summary: it is the retrospective analysis carried out by all the members of the work team once the project concludes, whether or not this conclusion is successful.

When carrying out this analysis, the aim is to identify the positive aspects applied in the project so that they can be repeated, as well as to propose solutions and improvements to the negative aspects, assimilating the experience so that they do not repeat themselves. All of this is simply known as Lessons Learned.

Carrying out an analysis of the good and bad experiences acquired in the project is necessary to:

    Identify the aspects that can be improved in future projects.
	    Obtain the experiences of all those involved in the project, concentrating opinions, points of view and generating group conclusions.
		    Form a knowledge base of "Lessons Learned" so that they are known, reviewed and considered in other projects with similar characteristics.
			    If there is a new project, the new resources that have access to the lessons learned will not be justified in repeating the same mistakes that were made in their previous projects.
